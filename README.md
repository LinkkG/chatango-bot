# chatango-bot
A bot made in Python 3 using (_a modified version of_) [ch.py](https://github.com/Nullspeaker/ch.py)<br/>
<br/>
This is the base for [TheBotx](https://thebotx.chatango.com/) and [Uqib](https://uqib.chatango.com/).<br/>
<br/>
## Currently supports:
* Websockets for rooms connections (at the moment, there is no need to use them in pm)
* A basic command system
* Multilanguage
* Per user configuration (like language or prefix)
* Per room configuration (like channels or badges)
